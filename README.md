# Newsletter 
When we talk about newsletter signup, we're referring to a process by which visitors elect to receive updates from an online business through email. 
By using an email newsletter signup form, visitors can enter their name and email address and hit subscribe.
Newsletters are one of the most powerful digital marketing tools at your disposal since they let you communicate directly with your prospects and customers in a personalized way by serving valuable content and relevant promotions straight to their inboxes.
